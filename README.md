This is a small project made by only HTML and CSS.
It was mainly done in 1st sem and a  very few changes were made in 3rd sem.
This is a static website ,made only for having hands on practice on web development.
Due to some complications,hosting the website wasnt possible,so the screenshots of the website have also been attached.
